# league-of-life
*ShellHacks 2023 submission by Ian Justiz and Bed Pandey*

Requires a Java installation with JavaFX support.

League of Life is a game where you use your limited mana to survive for as long as possible. 
Using six different automata algorithms, you can strategically choose when to swap algorithms in order to gain more points, or to try to get yourself out of desperate situations.
You can also pan, zoom, and you have a minimap that displays a representation of the current gameboard, and where you are zoomed in.
